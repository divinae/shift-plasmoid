"""Check that the config keys, the settings pages and the applet agree.

qmllint cannot see any of this: plasmoid.configuration is an attached property it does not
resolve, and a cfg_ alias for a key that does not exist is valid QML. So these mistakes are
invisible until someone opens the settings and finds a switch that does nothing.

Every one of these checks exists because the mistake it catches was actually shipped:

  * a settings page wrote to panel_countdown_layout and panel_progress_line, keys that were
    never declared - so the values had no default and did not survive a restart
  * those same two controls later described features whose implementation had been reverted,
    leaving dead switches in the settings
  * the preset selector read a key through a JS file it had not imported, and silently fell
    back to the first entry

Run from the repo root.
