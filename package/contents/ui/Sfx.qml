// Sound effects, with the MediaPlayer created only on first use.
//
// Merely constructing a MediaPlayer makes QtMultimedia probe hardware video
// decode. On a machine with the NVIDIA driver that loads libvdpau_nvidia.so,
// which opens /dev/nvidia* and holds it, so the dGPU never reaches D3cold - the
// applet kept the card awake just by sitting in the panel.
//
// Verified with a pair of minimal QML files: no MediaPlayer produces no VDPAU
// probe at all, one constructed and never played produces it. So nothing here
// touches QtMultimedia until a sound is actually asked for, and a user who never
// enables a sound never pays for it.
